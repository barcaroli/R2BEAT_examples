# R2BEAT workflows

Here are presented R2BEAT workflows under two scenarios:

- without previous rounds of the sampling survey to be designed, but with a complete sampling frame (scenario 1);
- with at least one previous round of the survey (scenario 2).

You can execute the workflows by using:

- the R script 'R2BEAT_workflows.R' (with R console or RStudio)
- the R markdown 'R2BEAT_workflows.Rmd' (with RStudio)
- the Jupyter notebook 'R2_workflows.ipynb' (Jupyter with an R kernel)
